      Kittens
Three little kittens
They lost their mittens,
Oh, mother dear,
We greatly fear
Lost your mittens,
You naughty kittens!
Then you shall have no pie.
Miew, miew, miew,
No, you shall have no pie.
Three little kittens
They found their mittens,
Oh, mother dear,
Our mittens we have found!
Found your mittens,
You clever kittens,
Then you shall have some pie.
Purr, purr, purr,
